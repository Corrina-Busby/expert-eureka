But how do you manage all those passwords? Bitwarden makes it easy for you to create, store, and access your passwords.\n\nBitwarden stores all of your logins in an encrypted vault that syncs across all of your devices. Since it's fully encrypted before it ever leaves your device, only you have access to your data. Not even the team at Bitwarden can read your data, even if we wanted to. Your data is sealed with AES-256 bit encryption, salted hashing, and PBKDF2 SHA-256.\n\nBitwarden is 100% open source software.
